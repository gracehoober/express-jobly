## Description:

- Visit the deployed application: [Jobly App](#) <!-- Add deployment link here -->
- The Jobly backend is built in Node.js and Express, serving as a pure API application.
- It handles values from query strings or a JSON body and returns JSON responses.
- Implements authentication and authorization functions using JWT tokens.
- This API allows filtering of jobs and companies based on the search criteria received from the front-end.

Future features include:
- Achieving 98% test coverage with additional tests.
- Adding technologies for jobs by introducing a table in the database that can be linked to many jobs.
- Incorporating technologies for users, similar to the addition of technologies for jobs.
- Implementing a feature where a random password is generated for users added by admins via the POST/users route. The system generates a random password, and users can change it after authentication.
